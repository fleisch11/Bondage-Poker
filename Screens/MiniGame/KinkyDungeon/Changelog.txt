1.2 (Apr 10 2021)
- First Beta Release


1.3 (Apr 26 2021)
Content
- Added locked chests which are scattered around the dungeon. Each floor is guaranteed to have at least one. You can either pick them or unlock them
- Added key drops and lockpick drops around the dungeon. You can find them in debris piles, but not chests.
- Added handcuffs trap, which places a set of handcuffs on you that has a guaranteed lock on it
- Added harness trap, which locks you in a harness that makes it easy for enemies to grab onto you
- Added various other restraints from chests
- Added scaling to the kinds of locks you encounter:
- New locks:
	Red locks are the most common in early levels, and can be only opened with red keys.
	Green locks are less common, and have a chance of jamming, making them impossible to unlock.
	Yellow locks require both a red and a green key to unlock.
	Blue locks require blue keys, and can't be picked or cut off. 
- Added Undressing System. Certain things will pull clothes off, you gain arousal when this happens and visually will blush when extremely naked and aroused.
- Added Shrines! These are a use for gold, and will basically take restraints off in exchange for an exponentially increasing amount of gold. Trapped treasure chests are also much more common now!
Balance
- Made the rope snare have a 3 turn delay rather than a 1 turn delay, and a range of 1. This limits its in-combat use, while retaining its long duration and level 1 classification

1.31
Content 
- Added a new enemy, a rope snake that sacrifices itself to wrap you up!
- Added a new spell, Electrify (which will be cast at you by witches in the future)
- Shock witches that cast electrical spells at you from a distance

1.32
Content 
- Chain bolt spell which stuns enemies
- Chain witch who fights by throwing chains at you. She will attempt to close the gap, and will lock the chains in place if she gets near!
- Goddesses of the elements, conjuration, and illusion who grant spells at a high cost
- Enemies now have resistances and weaknesses. Discover them the hard way!

Future content planned:
- Ability to close nearby doors
- Item shops scattered around the map, allowing you to buy swords and outfits
- Magical rope traps which require enchanted knives to cut
- Enchanted knives, which are found only in chests
- Latex witches that cast latex and slime spells at you from a distance
- Inventory system which lets you view special items and restraints (shows you how hard it is to break free from them... after you've struggled enough)
- Mana-boosting mittens which increase spell power and decrease mana costs, but make it harder to struggle out of things
- Enchanted heels which empower your melee attacks
- Items like swords and wands which improve melee attack damage or willpower
- More simple restraint traps: mittens, locked blindfolds/gags, leg irons, belts
- Chastity belt trap that puts a plug in you, increasing your arousal while walking
- Chastity belt trap that puts a toy in you. Toys are powered by casting magic
- New shrine: chastity goddess. Places you in a set of magic cuffs that prevent you from being restrained. However if your willpower falls below maximum, the cuffs snap together until you get back to full willpower!

Spell Ideas:
- Clear Jam spell, which clears jammed green locks from either an object or the player, depending on where it is cast
- Divine Cuffs, a spell which gives you glowing arm and leg cuffs that block low level restraints from being put on you. Lasts 10 turns.
- Ice Storm, a temporary AoE which has a chance to deal damage and stun creatures inside. Drains player willpower but does not slow or restraint the player.
- Sleep, puts nearby creatures with low willpower to sleep until they take damage. Works on zombies, and also the player if the player is at low willpower (<30).
